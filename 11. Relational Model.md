## RELATIONAL LANGUAGES
A data model is a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints. The relational model uses a collection of tables to represent both data and the relationships among those data. The
relational model describes data at the logical and view levels, abstracting away low-level details of data storage.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make data from a relational database available to users, we have to address how users specify requests for retrieving and updating data. Several query languages have been developed for this task.

### Introduction to the Relational Model 
The relational model remains the primary data model for commercial data-processing applications. It attained its primary position because of its simplicity, which eases the job of the programmer, compared to earlier data models such as the network model or the hierarchical model. It has retained this position by incorporating various new features and capabilities over its half-century of existence. Among those additions are object-relational features such as complex data types and stored procedures, support for XML data, and various tools to support semi-structured data.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relational model's independence from any specific underlying low-level data structures has allowed it to persist despite the advent of new approaches to data storage, including modern column-stores that are designed for large-scale data mining.

### Structure of Relational Databases:
A relational database consists of a collection of **tables**, each of which is assigned a unique name.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, a row in a table represents a *relationship* among a set of values. Since a table is a collection of such relationships, there is a close correspondence between the concept of *table* and the mathematical concept of *relation*, from which the relational data model takes its name.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the relational model the term **relation** is used to refer to a table, while the term **tuple** is used to refer to a row. Similarly, the term **attribute** refers to a column of a table.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use the term **relation instance** to refer to a specific instance of a relation, that is, containing a specific set of rows.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order in which tuples appear in a relation is irrelevant, since a relation is a set of tuples. Thus, whether the tuples of a relation are listed in sorted order does not matter. For ease of exposition, we generally show the relations sorted by their first attribute.  

For each attribute of a relation, there is a set of permitted values, called the **domain** of that attribute.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We require that, for all relations *r*, the domains of all attributes of *r* be atomic. A domain is **atomic** if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible and treated as a single, irreducible unit by the database system.
