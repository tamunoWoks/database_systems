## RELATIONAL LANGUAGES
A data model is a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints. The relational model uses a collection of tables to represent both data and the relationships among those data. The
relational model describes data at the logical and view levels, abstracting away low-level details of data storage.
