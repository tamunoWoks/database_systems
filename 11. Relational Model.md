## RELATIONAL LANGUAGES
A data model is a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints. The relational model uses a collection of tables to represent both data and the relationships among those data. The
relational model describes data at the logical and view levels, abstracting away low-level details of data storage.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make data from a relational database available to users, we have to address how users specify requests for retrieving and updating data. Several query languages have been developed for this task.

### Introduction to the Relational Model 
The relational model remains the primary data model for commercial data-processing applications. It attained its primary position because of its simplicity, which eases the job of the programmer, compared to earlier data models such as the network model or the hierarchical model. It has retained this position by incorporating various new features and capabilities over its half-century of existence. Among those additions are object-relational features such as complex data types and stored procedures, support for XML data, and various tools to support semi-structured data.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relational model's independence from any specific underlying low-level data structures has allowed it to persist despite the advent of new approaches to data storage, including modern column-stores that are designed for large-scale data mining.
