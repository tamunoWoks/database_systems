## Database Schema
When we talk about a database, we must differentiate between the **database schema**, which is the logical design of the database, and the **database instance**, which is a snapshot of the data in the database at a given instant in time.  
The concept of a relation corresponds to the programminglanguage notion of a variable, while the concept of a **relation schema** corresponds to the programming-language notion of type definition.
