## Database Schema
When we talk about a database, we must differentiate between the **database schema**, which is the logical design of the database, and the **database instance**, which is a snapshot of the data in the database at a given instant in time.  
The concept of a relation corresponds to the programming language notion of a variable, while the concept of a **relation schema** corresponds to the programming-language notion of type definition.  

In general, a relation schema consists of a list of attributes and their corresponding domains.  
The concept of a relation instance corresponds to the programming-language notion of a value of a variable. The value of a given variable may change with time; similarly the contents of a relation instance may change with time as the relation is updated. In contrast, the schema of a relation does not generally change.
