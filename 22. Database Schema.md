## Database Schema
When we talk about a database, we must differentiate between the **database schema**, which is the logical design of the database, and the **database instance**, which is a snapshot of the data in the database at a given instant in time.  
The concept of a relation corresponds to the programming language notion of a variable, while the concept of a **relation schema** corresponds to the programming-language notion of type definition.  

In general, a relation schema consists of a list of attributes and their corresponding domains.  
The concept of a relation instance corresponds to the programming-language notion of a value of a variable. The value of a given variable may change with time; similarly the contents of a relation instance may change with time as the relation is updated. In contrast, the schema of a relation does not generally change.  

Although it is important to know the difference between a relation schema and a relation instance, we often use the same name, to refer to both the schema and the instance. Where required, we explicitly refer to the schema or to the instance. However, where it is clear whether we mean the schema or the instance, we simply use the relation name.  

Using common attributes in relation schemas is one way of relating tuples of distinct relations. For example, there are many  relations maintained in a university database, such as *instructor, department, course, section, prereq, and teaches*, other relations include:
  - *student (ID, name, dept_name, tot_cred)*
  - *advisor (s_id, i_id)*
  - *takes (ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year, grade)*
  - *classroom (building, room_number, capacity)*
  - *timeslot (time_slot_id, day, start_time, end_time)*
