## Keys
We must have a way to specify how tuples within a given relation are distinguished. This is expressed in terms of their attributes.  
No two tuples in a relation are allowed to have exactly the same value for all attributes. That is, the values of the attribute values of a tuple must be such that they can *uniquely identify* the tuple.

### Superkey:
A **superkey** is a set of one or more columns (attributes) in a database table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in that table. Think of it as any combination of columns that guarantees uniqueness for every record.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the `ID` attribute of the relation `student` is sufficient to distinguish one student tuple from another. Thus, `ID` is a superkey. The `name` attribute of `student`, on the other hand, is not a superkey, because several students might have the same name.
