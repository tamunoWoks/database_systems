## Keys
We must have a way to specify how tuples within a given relation are distinguished. This is expressed in terms of their attributes.  
No two tuples in a relation are allowed to have exactly the same value for all attributes. That is, the values of the attribute values of a tuple must be such that they can *uniquely identify* the tuple.

### Superkey:
A **superkey** is a set of one or more columns (attributes) in a database table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in that table. Think of it as any combination of columns that guarantees uniqueness for every record.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the `ID` attribute of the relation `student` is sufficient to distinguish one student tuple from another. Thus, `ID` is a superkey. The `name` attribute of `student`, on the other hand, is not a superkey, because several students might have the same name.  

A superkey is just a broad definition for uniqueness. It might contain more columns than are necessary, but if you can look at the values in a set of columns and always point to exactly one row, that set of columns is a superkey.

#### Examples:
Let's use a Students table:

| StudentID | Email | CourseCode | YearEnrolled |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| 101 | `alice@school.edu` | CS101 | 2023 |
| 102 | `bob@school.edu` | CS101 | 2023 |
| 103 | `alice@school.edu` | MA202 | 2022 |

Which combinations are superkeys? (i.e., which combinations are unique for each row?)

| Combination | Unique? | Superkey? | Reason |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| `{StudentID}` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | 101, 102, 103 are all different |
| `{StudentID, Email}` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Contains StudentID which is already unique |
| `{Email}` | ❌ No | ❌ No | `alice@school.edu` appears twice |
| `{Email, CourseCode}` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Each combination appears only once |
| `{StudentID, Email, CourseCode}` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Contains StudentID which is already unique |
