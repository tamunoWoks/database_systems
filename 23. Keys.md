## Keys
In a relational database, **keys** are attributes (columns) or sets of attributes that are used to *uniquely identify* records within a table and to establish relationships between tables. They are fundamental to the structure, integrity, and power of a relational database. Think of them as the **unique identifiers** and **connectors** that give meaning to your data.

#### The Core Purpose of Keys:
Keys serve two primary functions:
1. **Uniquely Identify Records:** To ensure each row in a table can be distinguished from all others.
2. **Establish Relationships:** To link data in one table to data in another table.

### Superkey:
A **superkey** is a set of one or more columns (attributes) in a database table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in that table. Think of it as any combination of columns that guarantees uniqueness for every record.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the `ID` attribute of the relation `student` is sufficient to distinguish one student tuple from another. Thus, `ID` is a superkey. The `name` attribute of `student`, on the other hand, is not a superkey, because several students might have the same name.  

A superkey is just a broad definition for uniqueness. It might contain more columns than are necessary, but if you can look at the values in a set of columns and always point to exactly one row, that set of columns is a superkey.

#### Examples:
Let's use a Students table:

| StudentID | Email | CourseCode | YearEnrolled |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| 101 | `alice@school.edu` | CS101 | 2023 |
| 102 | `bob@school.edu` | CS101 | 2023 |
| 103 | `alice@school.edu` | MA202 | 2022 |

Which combinations are superkeys? (i.e., which combinations are unique for each row?)

| Combination | Unique? | Superkey? | Reason |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| `{StudentID}` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | 101, 102, 103 are all different |
| `{StudentID, Email}` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Contains StudentID which is already unique |
| `{Email}` | ❌ No | ❌ No | `alice@school.edu` appears twice |
| `{Email, CourseCode}` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Each combination appears only once |
| `{StudentID, Email, CourseCode}` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Contains StudentID which is already unique |

### Candidate Key:
A **candidate key** is a minimal superkey, a set of one or more columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table, and from which you cannot remove any column without destroying its uniqueness. Think of it as the shortest possible unique identifier for a table.  
The key idea is that a candidate key must satisfy two conditions:
1. **Uniqueness:** It must uniquely identify each row (like any superkey).
2. **Irreducibility (Minimality):** It must contain no unnecessary columns. If you remove any column from it, it would no longer be unique.
