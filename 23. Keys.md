## Keys
We must have a way to specify how tuples within a given relation are distinguished. This is expressed in terms of their attributes.  
That is, the values of the attribute values of a tuple must be such that they can *uniquely identify* the tuple. In other words, no two tuples in a relation are allowed to have exactly the same value for all attributes.
