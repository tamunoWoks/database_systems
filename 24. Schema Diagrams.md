## Schema Diagrams
**Schema Diagrams** (also called **Database Schemas** or **Entity-Relationship Diagrams - ERDs**) are visual representations of a database's structure. They illustrate the tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints, providing a blueprint of the entire database. Think of them as the architectural plans for your database.  

A database schema, along with primary key and foreign-key constraints, can be depicted by **schema diagrams**. Each relation appears as a box, with the relation name at the top and the attributes listed inside the box.
