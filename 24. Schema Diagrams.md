## Schema Diagrams
**Schema Diagrams** (also called **Database Schemas** or **Entity-Relationship Diagrams - ERDs**) are visual representations of a database's structure. They illustrate the tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints, providing a blueprint of the entire database. Think of them as the architectural plans for your database.  

A database schema, along with primary key and foreign-key constraints, can be depicted by **schema diagrams**. Each relation appears as a box, with the relation name at the top and the attributes listed inside the box. Below is an example of a University system Database Schema:

### Benefits of Using Schema Diagrams:
1. **Visual Clarity**: Quickly understand complex database structures.
2. **Error Prevention**: Identify design issues before implementation.
3. **Team Alignment**: Ensure everyone understands the data model.
4. **Change Management**: Plan and communicate database modifications.
5. **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand the database quickly.
