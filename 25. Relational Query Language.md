## Relational Query Languages
A **query language** is a language in which a user requests information from the database. These languages are usually on a
level higher than that of a standard programming language. Query languages can be categorized as imperative, functional, or declarative.

1. **Imperative Query Language:** The user instructs the system to perform a specific sequence of operations on the database to compute the desired result; such languages usually have a notion of state variables, which are updated in the course of the computation.
2. **Functional Query Language:** The computation is expressed as the evaluation of functions that may operate on data in the database or on the results of other functions; functions are side effect free, and they do not update the program state.
3. **Declarative Query Language:** The user describes the desired information without giving a specific sequence of steps or function calls for obtaining that information; the desired information is typically described using some form of mathematical logic. It is the job of the database system to figure out how to obtain the desired information.

Relational query languages are primarily declarative. This means you specify what data you want, not how to get it. The database's internal optimizer figures out the most efficient way to execute your request. The most prominent example is SQL (Structured Query Language), which has become the universal standard. However, SQL include elements of the imperative, functional, and declarative approaches.

### Advantages of Relational Query Languages:
1. **Simplicity**: English-like syntax makes it accessible.
2. **Portability**: SQL skills transfer across different database systems.
3. **Power**: Complex operations can be expressed concisely.
4. **Efficiency**: Set-based operations are highly optimized.
5. **Standardization**: ANSI/ISO standards ensure consistency.
6. **Security**: Built-in access control and authorization.
