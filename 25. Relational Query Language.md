## Relational Query Languages
A **query language** is a language in which a user requests information from the database. These languages are usually on a
level higher than that of a standard programming language. Query languages can be categorized as imperative, functional, or declarative.

1. **Imperative query language:** The user instructs the system to perform a specific sequence of operations on the database to compute the desired result; such languages usually have a notion of state variables, which are updated in the course of the computation.
