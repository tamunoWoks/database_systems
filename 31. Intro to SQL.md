## Overview of SQL
Although we refer to the SQL language as a “query language, ” it can do much more than just query a database. It can define the structure of the data, modify data in the database, and specify security constraints.  

SQL has several parts:
- **Data-definition language (DDL):** The SQL DDL provides commands for defining relation schemas, deleting relations, and modifying relation schemas.
- **Data-manipulation language (DML):** The SQL DML provides the ability to query information from the database and to insert tuples into, delete tuples from, and modify tuples in the database.
- **Integrity:** The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying integrity constraints that the data stored in the database must satisfy. Updates that violate integrity constraints are disallowed.
- **View definition:** The SQL DDL includes commands for defining views.
- **Transaction control:** SQL includes commands for specifying the beginning and end points of transactions.
- **Embedded SQL and Dynamic SQL:** Embedded and dynamic SQL define how SQL statements can be embedded within general-purpose programming languages, such as C, C++, and Java.
- **Authorization:** The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying access rights to relations and views.
