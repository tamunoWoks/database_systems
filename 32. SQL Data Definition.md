## SQL Data Definition
The set of relations in a database are specified using a data-definition language (DDL). The SQL DDL allows specification of not only a set of relations, but also information about each relation, including:
- The schema for each relation.
- The types of values associated with each attribute.
- The integrity constraints.
- The set of indices to be maintained for each relation.
- The security and authorization information for each relation.
- The physical storage structure of each relation on disk.

### Basic Data Types:
The SQL standard supports a variety of built-in types, including:
- **char(n):** A fixed-length character string with user-specified length n. The full form, **character**, can be used instead.
- **varchar(n):** A variable-length character string with userspecified maximum length n. The full form, **character varying**, is equivalent.
- **int:** An integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine dependent). The full form, **integer**, is equivalent.
- **smallint:** A small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer type).
- **numeric(p, d):** A fixed-point number with user-specified precision. The number consists of p digits (plus a sign), and d of the p digits are to the right of the decimal point. Thus, **numeric**(3, 1) allows 44. 5 to be stored exactly, but neither 444. 5 nor 0. 32 can be stored exactly in a field of this type.
- **real, double precision:** Floating-point and double-precision floating-point numbers with machine-dependent precision.
- **float(n):** A floating-point number with precision of at least *n* digits.

There are other data types we will deal with as we progress.  Each type may include a special value called the **null** value. A null value indicates an absent value that may exist but be unknown or that may not exist at all. In certain cases, we may wish to prohibit null values from being entered.  

The **char** data type stores fixed-length strings. Consider, for example, an attribute *A* of type **char**(10). If we stored a string “Avi” in this attribute, seven spaces are appended to the string to make it 10 characters long. In contrast, if attribute *B* were of type **varchar**(10), and we stored “Avi” in attribute *B*, no spaces would be added. When comparing two values of type **char**, if they are of different lengths, extra spaces are automatically attached to the shorter one to make them the same size before comparison.
