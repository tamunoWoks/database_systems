## SQL Data Definition
The set of relations in a database are specified using a data-definition language (DDL). The SQL DDL allows specification of not only a set of relations, but also information about each relation, including:
- The schema for each relation.
- The types of values associated with each attribute.
- The integrity constraints.
- The set of indices to be maintained for each relation.
- The security and authorization information for each relation.
- The physical storage structure of each relation on disk.
