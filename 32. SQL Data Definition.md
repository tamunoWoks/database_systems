## SQL Data Definition
The set of relations in a database are specified using a data-definition language (DDL). The SQL DDL allows specification of not only a set of relations, but also information about each relation, including:
- The schema for each relation.
- The types of values associated with each attribute.
- The integrity constraints.
- The set of indices to be maintained for each relation.
- The security and authorization information for each relation.
- The physical storage structure of each relation on disk.

### Basic Data Types:
The SQL standard supports a variety of built-in types, including:
- **char(n):** A fixed-length character string with user-specified length n. The full form, **character**, can be used instead.
- **varchar(n):** A variable-length character string with userspecified maximum length n. The full form, **character varying**, is equivalent.
- **int:** An integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine dependent). The full form, **integer**, is equivalent.
- **smallint:** A small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer type).
- **numeric(p, d):** A fixed-point number with user-specified precision. The number consists of p digits (plus a sign), and d of the p digits are to the right of the decimal point. Thus, **numeric**(3, 1) allows 44. 5 to be stored exactly, but neither 444. 5 nor 0. 32 can be stored exactly in a field of this type.
- **real, double precision:** Floating-point and double-precision floating-point numbers with machine-dependent precision.
- **float(n):** A floating-point number with precision of at least *n* digits.
