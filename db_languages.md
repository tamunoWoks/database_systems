## Database Languages
A database system provides a **data-definition language (DDL)** to specify the database schema and a **data-manipulation
language (DML)** to express database queries and updates. In practice, the data-definition and data-manipulation languages are not two separate languages; instead they simply form parts of a single database language, such as the SQL language. Almost all
relational database systems employ the SQL language.
