## Database Languages
A database system provides a **data-definition language (DDL)** to specify the database schema and a **data-manipulation
language (DML)** to express database queries and updates. In practice, the data-definition and data-manipulation languages are not two separate languages; instead they simply form parts of a single database language, such as the SQL language. Almost all
relational database systems employ the SQL language.

### Data-Definition Language:
We specify a database schema by a set of definitions expressed by a special language called a data-definition language (DDL). The DDL is also used to specify additional properties of the data.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We specify the storage structure and access methods used by the database system by a set of statements in a special type of DDL called a **data storage and definition** language. These statements define the implementation details of the database schemas, which are usually hidden from the users.
